## Key Takeaways for Our Strategy

### What We Can Learn

**Archetype Lessons:**
- Adopt a clear, memorable positioning that communicates a primary benefit (e.g., performance or style) and keep it consistently visible.

**Persuasion Lessons:**  
- Use authority (ambassadors, expert endorsements) and scarcity (limited drops) to create urgency and credibility.
- Leverage social proof on product pages to reduce purchase anxiety.

**Funnel Lessons:**
- Use bold hero messaging for awareness, curated collections for interest, detailed product storytelling for desire, and frictionless checkout for action.

### What We Should Do Differently
- Prioritize personalization across discovery and product pages.
- Simplify navigation for new users while retaining depth for engaged shoppers.
- Build a retention program that rewards repeat buyers and increases lifetime value.

### Specific Implementation Ideas
1. Add a short “Which product is right for you?” quiz to guide first-time shoppers to tailored collections.
2. Run limited-time micro-drops with clear scarcity signals to boost urgency for launches.
3. Implement on-product comparison and fit guides to reduce returns and increase buyer confidence.
