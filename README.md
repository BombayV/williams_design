# Brand Strategy Research Project

### Learn to collaborate, think strategically, and design with purpose

In this project, a team of 2–3 students will learn how brands use psychology, design, and storytelling to connect with people, and how to use GitHub to collaborate like real designers and developers.

## Clothing Brands
We worked on clothing brands and decided to choose the champion archetype. We want a brand the empowers athletes, therefore we're going to be competing against big companies such as Nike, Adidas, and Puma.
