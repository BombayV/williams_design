   - Psychology: We follow credible experts

4. **Consistency** - "Small yes leads to big yes"

   - Psychology: We act consistently with previous commitments

5. **Liking** - "Buy from people we like"
   - Example: Friendly brand voice, relatable ambassadors, shared values
   - Psychology: We say yes to people similar to us

6. **Social Proof** - "Everyone else is doing it"
   - Example: Reviews, testimonials, "Join 1M+ users"
   - Psychology: We look to others when uncertain
